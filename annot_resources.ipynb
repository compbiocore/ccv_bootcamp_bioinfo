We can use biomaRt to query Ensembl for annotations so that we can look for 'housekeeping genes' which are typically considered to be stably expressed and shouldn't show large variations across different samples. We have selected a list of genes based on two publications that queried public cancer genome data to find housekeeping genes for use with RNA-seq from cancer cell lines (https://doi.org/10.1186/s12859-019-2809-2, https://doi.org/10.3389/fgene.2019.00097).
